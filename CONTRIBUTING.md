## Code of Conduct

Be respectful, constructive, and kind.
Report any unacceptable behavior to one of the [maintainers](#contact).

<a name="#before-you-start"></a>
## Before You Start

- Read the `README.md` and project documentation carefully.
- **Run the notebook tutorials first** to:
  - Verify your environment setup
  - Understand what the tool does
  - Get familiar with workflows and expected outputs

This helps avoid duplicated work and misunderstandings.

<a name="#how-to-contribute"></a>
## How to Contribute

All contributions follow this workflow:

### 1. Find or Propose an Issue

- Check if the bug/feature is already listed in **open issues**.
- If not, **create a new issue** describing:
  - The problem or improvement
  - Proposed approach (if any)
  - Expected impact
  - Relevant examples (code, screenshots, references)

**No Pull Requests without an associated issue.**

### 2. Express Interest Before Starting Work

Before starting work — especially for **non-trivial issues**:

- Comment on the issue expressing your interest.
- Briefly describe your proposed approach.
- Align on expectations, requirements, and scope.

This avoids duplicated efforts and ensures clarity.

### 3. Development Workflow

The following points depend on your repository permissions.

* **[If you have write permission] Work in a separate branch always:**
  - Always work on a **separate branch**
  - Use descriptive branch names (e.g., `issue_123_feature_name`)
  - Write clear and meaningful commit messages
  - Do not merge your own PRs

* **[If you have read-only permission] Fork the repository:**
  - Fork the repository
  - Work on your fork
  - Submit a Pull Request from your branch

### 4. Code Quality Requirements

Before opening a PR:

- Code must be formatted with **Black**
- All functions must include **Sphinx-style docstrings**
- Code must be properly tested
- Ensure notebooks and examples still run correctly

### 5. AI-Assisted Code Policy

We are **OK with AI-assisted code**, with the following expectations:

- AI-generated code must be **thoroughly tested**
- You must fully understand the code you submit
- The PR description should clearly explain:
  - What the code does
  - Why it solves the issue
  - Any design decisions made
- Conversations in issues and PRs are encouraged to be **human-to-human**
- Code must be relevant and scoped to the issue it addresses

Submissions that are unclear, untested, or poorly explained may be rejected.

### 6. Opening a Pull Request

When submitting a PR:

- Reference the related issue
- Clearly describe:
  - What was changed
  - Why it was changed
  - How it was tested
- Add relevant screenshots or examples if helpful
- Respond to reviewer feedback in a timely manner (within weeks, not months)

A maintainer will review your PR and may request modifications.
